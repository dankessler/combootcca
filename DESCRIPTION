Description: A package for conducting inference on the canonical directions
    obtained from canonical correlation analysis (CCA). It contains a variety of
    user-facing functions with names like cca_ci_boot for constructing
    confidence intervals for the coordinates of canonical directions. The
    centerpiece is cca_ci_combootcca, which uses a bootstrap-based approach that
    uses a weighted Hungarian algorithm to align bootstrap replicates to a
    reference solution.
